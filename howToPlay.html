    <p>
      Black Or Red is a game of debate, manipulations and lies. <br> <br>
      Each player gets either black or red card. <br> <br>
      You can choose who will be the villians in the game. Let's say that we choose the reds to be the villians. <br><br>
      The purpose of the blacks is to reveal all the reds,
      while the purpose of the reds is to eliminate all the blacks without being discovered. <br> <br>
      The blacks wins when they succeed to reveal all the reds. <br> <br>
      The reds wins when the number of the reds equal to the number of the blacks left in the game. <br> <br>
    </p>

      Choose a narrator. Before the game start, the narrator asks from all the participants to close their eyes.<br><br>
      Then he asks for the villians to raise their head and watch each other.<br>
      After the villians watch each other, The narrator ask them to close their eyes again.<br><br>
